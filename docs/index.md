# About AutoFixture.XUnit2.AutoMock

AutoFixture.XUnit2.AutoMock is a free, open source tool that accelerates the preparation of mocked structures for unit tests under [XUnit2](http://xunit.net/) by configuring [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) to work with the mocking library of your choice. It gracefully handles recursive structures by omitting recursions.
