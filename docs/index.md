# About AutoFixture.XUnit2.AutoMock

AutoFixture.XUnit2.AutoMock is a free, open source tool which accelerates preparation of mocked structures for unit tests under [XUnit2](http://xunit.github.io/) by configuring [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) data generation to use a mocking library of your choice. Gracefully handles recursive structures by omitting recursions.
